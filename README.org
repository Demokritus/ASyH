* ASyH
The Anonymous Synthesizer for Health Data

The ASyH is a software helping Clinics as holders of large quantities of highly restricted personal health data to provide the Medical Data Community with realistic datasets without the breach of privacy.  It does this by synthesizing data with Machine Learning techniques which preserve data distribution and correlation while adding as much variation to the synthetic data, in order for it to have no resemblance any of the original patient data entries.

For synthesis, metrics and quality assurance we will mainly use the [[https://sdv.dev][Synthetic Data Vault]] ([[https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV][github]]).
